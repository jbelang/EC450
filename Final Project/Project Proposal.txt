					    "I am having trouble with my Basil"


We have both had plants die because we could not properly track their environmental conditions (Dimi's basil, Jesse's cactus), 
so for our project, we thought of making a plant environment monitor. The device would periodically measure the soil moisture 
and light exposure levels of the plant, and alert the caretaker if either of these conditions became sub-optimal. We would be 
able to detect such states as under-watered, over-watered, too shady, or too bright (the thresholds of which would be tailored 
to the plant in care). Our device would utilize both a speaker and an LED to communicate these alerts both audibly and visually, 
and our design would allow for different combinations of the two to signal different plant-needs. We would use a soil moisture sensor 
compatible with the MSP430 to detect the moisture levels, and probably a photoresistor to detect the light levels.
